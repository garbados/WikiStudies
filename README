WikiStudies Mission
[Written by garbados, circa January 2011]
* Allow researchers to publish their own studies and edit them as findings evolve and/or in response to peer review.
* Allow researchers to review, rate, discuss, and comment on other submitted studies, whether in whole or in part.
* Allow the general public to peruse the body of submitted studies and their discussions and participate by means of votes and other ratings.
* Track findings across studies to reach a better synthesized comprehension of that phenomena.


WikiStudies Purpose
[Written by garbados, circa January 2011]
* Eliminate Publisher Bias: When researchers can publish their own works, their findings can flow more freely through the scientific community and, by extension, the world.
* Advance Scientific Rigor and Transparency: When peer review becomes an ongoing process involving hundreds, possibly thousands of researchers, research becomes more reliable, and the scientific community improves.
